class Solution{
public:
    void reverse(int arr[], int n){
        int s=0;
        int e=n-1;
        while(s<e){
            swap(arr[s],arr[e]);
            s=s+1;
            e=e-1;
        }
        
    }
};


here what we did was we considered the starting and ending of the array.Initializing it with "s" for start and "e" for end. s starts from 0 while n starts from n-1.
we need to make sure s<e using a while loop otherwise the loop will go indefinitely.Using the swap function in cpp we swap s and e,increment s along with decrementing e.
